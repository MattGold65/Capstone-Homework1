# Capstone-Homework1
Program is broken up into three go files.

Main.go --> Here I just initilize some items and print out the prices.

tax.go --> Here I initialize the item struct along with all the functions I used in this homework. The main function I am testing is checkoutAmount(), all other functions in tax.go are helper functions.

tax_test.go --> Here is where my tests are located. I wrote a test for each state mentioned in this homework assignment along with a test that ensures that an error does return when an invalid state abbriviation is passed in, and that NJ sales tax is applied to fur clothing.

All tests should pass and are ran by just running the tax_test.go file.
